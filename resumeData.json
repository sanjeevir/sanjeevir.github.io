We built this application using cutting edge front end technologies including HTML5, AngularJS, LESS CSS and other front end build tools comprising of Yeoman for structuring the application, Grunt for build automation and Karma, Jasmine, Protractor for test cases, code analysis and reporting. Also the application is hosted on Adobe-AEM(CQ5) enabling immediate site updates with zero application downtime. And on the server side, we built REST micro services on Node JS server that will allow service updates in part and patches, again with no down time at all."
